# Karl Keshavarzi

**Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo**

I build simulations, embedded systems, and software that sits close to the hardware. My projects start with a physical system and end with working code.

## Projects

### **∇ × E = −∂B/∂t**
**[Finite-Difference Maxwell Solver](https://github.com/karl-kes/FDTD-Wave-Solver)**  
Finite-difference time-domain solver for Maxwell's equations; simulates the electric and magnetic fields corresponding to various sources. Validated with plane wave tests and analytical solutions.

### **F = Gm₁m₂/r²**
**[N-Body Gravity Engine](https://github.com/karl-kes/N-Body-Gravity-Simulator)**  
N-Body physics engine simulationg gravity with symplectic Yoshida integration. Validated solar system dynamics with NASA JPL Horizons data across 249 years.

### **L ∝ R² × T⁴**
**[ExoDiscover](https://github.com/wentingcoding960206/ExoDiscover)**  
Exoplanet exploration tool for NASA Space Apps. Integrated XGBoost/CNN models (70% detection accuracy) with React/Three.js frontend rendering 20,000+ exoplanets. Top 4 finish, 150 participants.

### **d/dt(∂L/∂q̇) − ∂L/∂q = 0**
**[Classical Mechanics Problem Sets](https://github.com/karl-kes/Classical_Mechanics_PSets)**  
100+ problems covering kinematics through wave mechanics. Co-authored with UWaterloo ECE for the official ECE 105 course text.
