**Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo**

I build simulations, embedded systems, and software that sits close to the hardware. My projects start with a physical system and end with working code.

## Projects

### **F = Gm₁m₂/r²**
**[N-Body Gravity Simulator](https://github.com/karl-kes/N-Body-Gravity-Simulator)**  
Gravitational n-body simulation with symplectic Verlet integration. Sub-0.0002% energy drift over 31.5M seconds. Parallelized with OpenMP for 1000+ bodies at 500M+ FLOP/s. C++ backend, VPython 3D rendering.

### **∇ × E = −∂B/∂t**
**[FDTD Wave Solver](https://github.com/karl-kes/FDTD-Wave-Solver)**  
Finite-difference time-domain solver for Maxwell's equations. Yee-cell field updates with Courant-stable time-stepping. Visualizes EM wave propagation across arbitrary grid sizes. *(In progress)*

### **F = μ₀I²L / 2πd**
**Electromagnetic Propulsion System**  
3-stage coilgun with 200+ turn coils and 200J capacitor bank (200V/9,400µF). Handles 180A+ inrush with Arduino-controlled gate timing. Targeting 100+ km/h projectile velocity. Custom PCB in progress.

### **L ∝ R² × T⁴**
**[ExoDiscover](https://github.com/wentingcoding960206/ExoDiscover)**  
Exoplanet exploration tool for NASA Space Apps. Integrated XGBoost/CNN models (70% detection accuracy) with React/Three.js frontend rendering 20,000+ exoplanets. Top 4 finish, 150 participants.

### **d/dt(∂L/∂q̇) − ∂L/∂q = 0**
**[Classical Mechanics Problem Sets](https://github.com/karl-kes/Classical_Mechanics_PSets)**  
100+ problems covering kinematics through wave mechanics. Co-authored with UWaterloo ECE for the official ECE 105 course text.
